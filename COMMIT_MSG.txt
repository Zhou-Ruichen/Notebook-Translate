feat: Release v0.3.0 - Security Upgrade & Profile System

## Major Features
- **Security Upgrade**: API Keys are now stored in VSCode's `SecretStorage` (Keychain) instead of plaintext settings.
- **Profile System**: Support multiple translation profiles (OpenAI, Ollama, Baidu) with easy switching via `Select Profile`.
- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - Added Status Bar item for real-time connection feedback.
  - Silent connection testing to reduce notification noise.
  - Normalized command titles (e.g., `IPynb Translator: ...`).
- **Translation Logic**:
  - Support for Custom System Prompts per profile.
  - Auto-cleaning of `<think>` tags from reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek R1).

## Breaking Changes
- **Configuration**: Deprecated flat configuration keys (`ipynbTranslator.openai.apiKey`, etc.). Users will be auto-migrated to the new Profile system on first run.
- **Commands**: Renamed commands to follow a consistent naming convention.

## Security
- API Keys are stripped from `settings.json` upon saving and migrated to secure storage.
- New `Set API Key` command allows safe key updates and deletion.
